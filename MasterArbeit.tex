%%    Die Frage ist, ob das jetzt noch eine Idee ist, den Detektoraufbau von der systematischen Teilchenbestimmungs-Seite aufzuziehen, quasi so, wie man es in der Masterclass lernt, mit einzelnen Spuren unterscheiden usw... --> siehe hierfür das Skript zusammenfassung ATLAS skript wie https://cds.cern.ch/record/1096081/export/hx?ln=en und https://cds.cern.ch/record/1096081, oder ob das nicht dann doch zu viel wird

%FCNC im LQ Kaptiel braucht sehr wahrscheinlich eine Erklärung!! + schwacher isospin
%
% im pp LQpair prod chapter: den channel nochmal genauer spezifizieren und zur LQ tabelle bezug nehmen, vielleicht kann man auch noch ein bisschen mehr dazu sagen+generic? + final state results in jets/bjets plus tau ->verweis auf Physical objects chapter

\chapter{Theoretical background for the search for scalar leptoquarks}\label{theory}
This chapter describes theoretical foundations required for the search for scalar leptoquarks including the successful Standard Model of elementary particle physics evolved from the symbiosis of experimental achievements and theoretical milestones. Besides its success some issues still remain unsolved and could be a hint to physics beyond the Standard Model, giving space to introduce the Leptoquark Model as one possible extension. 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{The Standard Model of particle physics}\label{SM}
A remarkable development for understanding nature is the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics, embracing physics at the most fundamental level. This quantum field theory, incorporating the conceptual frameworks of special relativity and quantum mechanics, describes the constituents of matter and the laws governing their interactions. \cite{Mann} Despite its success of being the most promising theory so far capable of explaining the observed results within its domain in agreement with empirical data, it seems not to be the complete story. \cite{Nair}\par
One of the most important concept in physics is that of symmetries, because they are deeply connected with conservation laws, following Noether`s Theorem. A physical property responds to a symmetry transformation in two different ways. It can appear in form of an invariant under symmetry transformation, leaving that property unchanged, or as covariant, changing their property induced by the symmetry transformation. %Continuous symmetries yield additive laws whereas discrete symmetries result in multiplicative laws.

		\caption[Lie symmetry groups of the Standard Model.]{Lie symmetry groups for the gauge interactions of the Standard Model \cite{Mann}.}
		\label{sym}
	\end{table}
Fundamental symmetries of particle physics include space translation symmetry and hence the conservation of momentum, rotational invariance and hence conservation of angular momentum and time translation invariance leading to energy conservation. The formal mathematical description for fundamental symmetries is based on group theory. In case of particle physics almost all groups are Lie groups $\mathcal{G}$, that are a set of objects $\{g_i\}$, which can be combined with a binary operation and has four basic properties: closure, identity, inverse element and associativity. Additionally, the group elements are continuous and differentiable functions of some finite set of parameters $\theta_{a}$:
\begin{align}
                g=g(\theta_1, \ldots, \theta_N)=\exp\left[i\theta_a\mathbf{T}^a\right]=\exp\left[i\vec{\theta}\vec{\mathbf{T}}\right]\qquad \text{with}\quad a=1,\ldots,N
\end{align}
Here $\mathbf{T}^a$ are the generators of the group from which all elements of the group can be created. The irreducible representatives of a group can be written as complex matrices\footnote{Irreducible means that not all representing matrices of the group can be decomposed into block-diagonal form simultaneously \cite{Mann}.}, acting on the wave function of the particles and on charges as well as on space-time coordinates. \cite{Mann}
The local symmetry $SU(3)_c\times SU(2)_L\times U(1)_Y$ summarizes the gauge interactions of the SM (see table \ref{sym}). Here $c$ indicates the strong force, $L$ the left handed chirality of the weak regime and $Y=B+s$ the hypercharge calculated from baryon number $B$ and strangeness $s$. \cite{PhysTeV} Besides the continuous symmetries above also important discrete symmetries exist in the SM like parity $P$, referring to the transformation $\vec{x}\rightarrow-\vec{x}$, time reversal $T$, referring to $t\rightarrow-t$, and charge conjugation $C$, corresponding to the exchange of a particle with its anti-particle. The weak force breaks $P$ and $C$, but not the product of $CPT$. \cite{Nair}\par
Matter and its interactions can be described by two basic types of particles and four fundamental forces, i.e. the electromagnetic force, the weak and the strong force and gravity. Fermionic particles, following Fermi-Dirac statistics, make up matter, whereas bosons, following Bose-Einstein statistics, are acting as mediators of the fundamental forces. \cite{Cottingham}\cite{Griffiths}\newline
The fermions can be further categorized into $6$ leptons $l$ characterized through the lepton quantum number $L_l$ and $6$ quarks $q$ characterized through the baryon quantum number $B$ together with their anti-particles ($\bar{l}$ respectively $\bar{q}$). The only difference between particle and anti-particle is contrary electrical charge and contrary lepton and baryon number respectively. Leptons occur in three generations with different flavour -- electron (e), muon ($\mu$) and tauon ($\tau$) -- and can carry electrical charge $Q=\pm e$ in units of the elementary charge. The electrically neutral leptons are the neutrinos $\nu_l$. \cite{Griffiths}\newline
Table \ref{SMtable} shows the leptons with selected properties.\newline

		\label{SMtable}
	\end{table}
The quarks also occur in three generations and carry electrical charge of either $Q=\pm\frac13 e$ or $Q=\pm\frac23 e$ in units of the elementary charge as well as color charge. Possible color charges are red, green and blue and the additional anti-colors indicate that quarks are interacting with the strong force among the electromagnetic and weak interaction. \cite{Griffiths} Quarks only occur confined in color-neutral compound systems called hadrons. Baryons are three-quark hadronic states with baryon number $1$ and mesons are quark-anti-quark hadronic states, having a baryon number of $0$. \cite{Cottingham} The reason for quark confinement can be found in the potential $V(r)$ between quarks and anti-quarks depending on distance $r$. The potential has the shape $V(r)\propto\frac{-1}{r}+\text{const}\cdot r$. When separating a quark-anti-quark pair, additional potential energy must be supplied, which can exceed the potential $V(R)>2m_q$ for more than two quark masses at distance $R$. Quantum fluctuations result in the origin of a new quark pair in between. The final state now consists of two pairs, again externally color-neutral. \cite{Nair} Table \ref{SMtable} shows the different quark flavors up, down, charm, strange, top and bottom with some characteristic properties. \newline
The bosons shown in table \ref{SMtable} are the quanta of the fundamental forces \cite{Cottingham}:
\begin{itemize}
\item{The photon $\gamma$ is the mediator of the electromagnetic force.}
\item{Three mediators Z$^0$, W$^+$ and W$^-$ for the weak force.}
\item{$8$ colored gluons as mediators for the strong force.}
\item{The Higgs boson H$^0$ as quantum of the Higgs field, providing the masses for the elementary particles.}
\end{itemize}
At the current state of research a quantum field theory of gravity is purely hypothetical. The mediator for such theory would be the graviton (see chapter \ref{beyondSM}). A second aspect is that on elementary particle scales gravity is insignificant compared\footnote{Relative strength of gravity compared to the weak interaction is $10^{-35}$ \cite{Mann}.} to all other forces and is therefore not originally considered in the SM. \cite{Cottingham}\par

\section{Beyond the scope of the Standard Model}\label{beyondSM}
Nevertheless there are still many puzzles left which are not described by the SM. That circumstance keeps physicists well motivated to gain further progress and to push the frontiers of our understanding. \cite{Nair}
\paragraph{Neutrino masses} are confirmed by various neutrino oscillation experiments \cite{Kajita}\cite{McDonald}, although the SM does not predict neutrino masses. The neutrino flavor states $\nu_\alpha$ with $\alpha=e,\mu,\tau$ are quantum entangled with the mass states $\nu_i$ where $i=1,2,3$ described by an unitary matrix $U_{\alpha i}$ \cite{mixing}. One possible extension of the SM, explaining neutrino masses, is the seesaw meachanism. Because of the absence of the right chirality spinor components $\Psi_{R,j}$, the mass term of the Dirac lagrangian $\bar{\Psi}_L\Psi_R+\bar{\Psi}_R\Psi_L$ cannot be formed in case of neutrinos. One possible solution is to describe the neutrino masses with a Majorana mass term, which introduces very massive\footnote{So massive that they are beyond the today`s mass limits, because so far there is no experimental evidence for such neutrinos \cite{Nair}.} right-chiral neutrinos besides light weight left-chiral neutrinos. One caveat is that such right-chiral neutrinos then have to exist, although within the SM there are only left-handed neutrinos known. \cite{Nair}
\paragraph{Quantum gravity} could be the embedding of general relativity into a framework of quantum theory. Quantum theory provides a well confirmed framework for all theories describing particular interactions. Therefore it would be appealing to have a quantum formulation of gravity, following the example of all other fundamental forces and being one step closer to an unificated description. From the view point of cosmology, quantum gravity could be an encompassing theory for a more fundamental understanding where general relativity breaks down, when it comes to the initial conditions of the early universe or conditions of black holes. \cite{quantumgravity}
\paragraph{The hierarchy problem} is a current challenge in particle physics and arises from quadratic corrections to the weak scale. \cite{hierarchy} The hierarchy problem formulates the huge differences of scales where symmetries are broken. Considering a single, unifying symmetry, including the standard model symmetries $SU(3)_c\times SU(2)_L\times U(1)_Y$ (see chapter \ref{SM}),which has to be broken at scale $V$, because it is not manifested at the currently explored energy scales. A lower bound is $V\approx 10^{37}\,\text{GeV}$. At the same time spontaneous symmetry breaking takes place for $SU(2)_L\times U(1)_Y$ at scales of $v\approx\SI{246}{\giga\electronvolt}$\footnote{This is the vacuum expectation value for the Higgs field. \cite{VEV}} in order to get massive W$^\pm$ and Z$^0$ bosons as well es massive quarks and leptons. Within the framework of perturbation theory in quantum field theory such great scale differences are difficult to keep due to the fact that corrections of symmetry breaking are controlled by the highest masses involved. The approach for $v$ is $v^2=v_0^2\sum_{i=1}^kc_i\lambda^i V_0^2$ with the initial value $v_0$, the coupling constant $\lambda$ and general coefficients $c_i$. This shows that including the first correction order the equation is $v^2=v_0^2+c_1\lambda V_0^2$. The consequence is that $v_0^2$ has to be adjusted in such a way that it cancels out several decimal places, for instance 25, of the term $c_1\lambda V_0^2$, but the decimal places beyond that limit should add up to the scale of $\SI{246}{\giga\electronvolt}$. This fine tuning is an unsatisfactory situation, even worsened by adding one more order of quantum correction. \cite{Nair} A non-perturbative solution to the hierarchy problem is proposed by supersymmetric models. \cite{nonperturbative} 
%passt hier wahrscheinlich doch nicht so gut hin, ist ja nicht so wesentlich jetzt für mich... Was ich mir vorstellen könnte ist, dass man das als relativierung zu GUT erklärt, dass auch GUT nicht die eierlegende Wollmilchsau ist--
\paragraph{Supersymmmetry (SUSY)} is a symmetry, which unifies fermions and bosons. The corresponding transformation can be described with an operator in spinor form $Q_{\alpha i}$ and converts fermion fields into boson fields and vice versa. Here $\alpha$ is the spinor index and $i$ are internal degrees of freedom. The field pairs are called superpartners (sparticles) and belong to the same multiplet. The difference between particles and sparticles is the spin quantum number which distinguishes them by half an unit of $\hbar$. \cite{Vergados} Due to no evidence of sparticles, having masses in the same range as the already known elementary particles, also supersymmetry has to be broken. \cite{PhysTeV}. {\SUSY} is very attractive, because it can solve the hierarchy problem, achieve gauge unification and can even provide a candidate for dark matter. \cite{Nagashima} There are two main categories of supersymmetry models, namely $R$-parity conserving and $R$-parity violating models. $R$ is a discrete symmetry in the coupling of particles and their superpartners, defined as \cite{Vergados}:
\begin{align}
                        R=(-1)^{2S+3B+L}=                                       \begin{cases}
                                        +1 & \, \text{for ordinary particles} \\
                                        -1 & \, \text{for {\SUSY} particles}     \end{cases}
                                        \text{,}
\label{Rparity}
\end{align}
where $S$ is the spin, $B$ the baryon number and $L$ the lepton number. An exactly conserved $R$-parity will result in a stable lightest supersymmetric particle and the {\SUSY} particles will be produced in pairs. Whereas a $R$-parity violation will result in singly producable sparticles and all of them are intrinsically unstable. \cite{Kuze}

\section{Leptoquarks}\label{LQmodels}
Different shortcomings of the Standardmodel open up chances to extend the the current understanding with concepts briefly introduced in chapter \ref{beyondSM}. One basic idea further develops the symmetry approach, taking the current one as an example (see chapter \ref{SM}), into a great unified theory ({\GUT}). This can be made possible by embedding the SM gauge groups $SU(3)_c\times SU(2)_L\times U(1)_Y$ into a higher symmetry $G_\text{{\GUT}}$. This group has to be broken at the so called ${\GUT}$-scale of $\geq 10^{16}\,\SI{}{\giga\electronvolt}$ to such an extend that the three SM interactions occur as seperate interactions. \cite{PhysTeV} The previously mentioned issues in chapter \ref{beyondSM} already gave a hint on this unification concept in different degrees of manifestations and show that {\GUT} is a solution candidate for different issues. Moreover {\GUT}s imply new gauge bosons called leptoquarks (LQ), which would explain the strong similarities between leptons and quarks. \cite{Nagashima}
%
%
\subsection{Leptoquarks and grand unified theories}
The first {\GUT} was proposed by Georgi and Glashow \cite{GeorgiGlashow}. They proposed that the group $SU(5)$ incorporates all the fermions into one multiplet following the same universal coupling. This enables the possibility to transforms leptons and quarks into each other with leptoquarks as mediators. \cite{Perkins} Altought the Georgi-Glashow model had a great impact, this model is ruled out. It predicts a lifetime of the proton of $10^{30}\,\text{y}$, but the current experimental lower limit is $10^{33}\,\text{y}$. \cite{Griffiths}\par%vllt noch einen Feynmangraph zum Proton Zerfall S. 408, Griffiths
Another unifying group would be $SO(10)$, which is broken to $SO(10)\rightarrow SU(4)_c\times SU(2)_L\times SU(2)_R$, where the leptons are treated as a forth color. \cite{PatiSalamExplanation} This model is the Pati-Salam {\GUT} model \cite{PatiSalam}. Here also the right-handed leptons are included, acting different than their left-chiral counterpart as it is expected for solutions of the neutrino masses for example. \cite{PatiSalamExplanation}\par
Other symmetry groups like $E_6$, inspired by superstring models, are also canditates for a {\GUT} theory. \cite{E6} $E_6$ has a rank of $6$ and is member of the exceptional Lie groups. Furthermore it can be seen as the natural extension of $SU(5)$ and $SU(10)$ and includes a greater set of particles, interpreting them as dark matter candidates. \cite{E6explanation}

%
The introduction of the effective leptoquark models closely follows \cite{Kuze}.\newline
Leptoquarks are color-triplet scalar $(S)$ or vector $(V)$ bosons having baryon and lepton numbers and carry fractional electrical charge. \cite{Kuze} A general formulation of an effective Lagrangian for leptoquark interaction with the SM fermions was proposed by Buchm\"{u}ller, R\"{u}ckl and Wyler \cite{BRW}. It assumes that LQs
\begin{itemize}
\item[(i)] have renormalizable interactions.
\item[(ii)] have interactions invariant under the SM gauge symmetries $SU(3)_c\times SU(2)_L\times U(1)_Y$.
\item[(iii)] couple only to the SM fermions, gauge bosons and the Higgs boson.
\item[(iv)] are required to conserve the lepton number $L$ and the baryon number $B$ seperately. They carry the fermion number
\begin{align}
                        F=3B+L
\label{fermionnumber}
\end{align}
of $|F|=0$ or $|F|=2$.
\item[(v)] each LQ couples to only a single quark-lepton generation, i.e. three LQ families.
\item[(vi)] has pure chiral couplings to the SM fermions.
\end{itemize}
Condition (iv) makes sure that the proton instability is avoided. Condition (v) only allows inter-generational interactions and large tree-level flavor changing neutral currents and flavor universalites. Condition (vi) supresses contributions to chirally meson decays like $\pi\rightarrow e\nu$. The LQ model, fulfilling (i)-(vi), is the so called minimal-Buchm\"{u}ller-R\"{u}ckl-Wyler effective model (mBRW) with coupling constant $\lambda$. \cite{Kuze}\newline
Fourteen different leptoquark types are known and are listed in table \ref{LQstable}. The same symbol represents LQs of different electric charge within an isospin family, i.e. $S_{1/2,L}$ stands for both, the $S_{1/2}$ state of charge $-\frac53$ and for $-\frac23$. Here $l_X$ are the left-handed lepton doublets in case of $X=L$ and the right handed lepton singlet in case of $X=R$. This differentiation between left-chiral and right-chiral is also valid for the quarks $q_X$ of up-type ($q=u$) or down-type ($q=d$). Seven of the fourteen LQs are scalars ($S_{0,L}$, $S_{0,R}$, $\tilde{S}_{0,R}$, $S_{1,L}$, $S_{1/2,L}$, $S_{1/2,R}$, $\tilde{S}_{1/2,L}$) and seven are vectors ($V_{0,L}$, $V_{0,R}$, $\tilde{V}_{0,R}$, $V_{1,L}$, $V_{1/2,L}$, $V_{1/2,R}$, $\tilde{V}_{1/2,L}$) with their fermion number $|F|=0$ and $|F|=2$. For specific models based on mBRW the branching ratio $\beta(LQ\rightarrow lq)$ are usually fixed to values like $0$, $\frac12$ or $1$. \cite{Kuze}\par
From the experimentalist point of view it makes sense to expand the phenomenology of leptoquarks and ease some restrictions of the mBRW model, giving rise to more generic models. One example is to assume the  branching ratio $\beta$ as a free parameter. Relaxing (iv) or (v) in the lepton sector could open new lepton-flavour violating decays. The result is that the search for leptoquarks is more sensitive to all the various possibilities. \cite{Kuze}

\subsection{Leptoquark-like couplings in supersymmetry}
An additional generic picture can result from the view point of supersymmetry. In $R$-parity violating {\SUSY} models squarks can produce leptoquark-like signature, because of decay modes involving Yukawa coupling\footnote{Yukawa coupling describes the interaction of a scalar field with a scalar or pseudoscalar Dirac field \cite{Peskin}.}. The left-chiral $\tilde{u}_L$\footnote{Usually the supersymmetric partner particles are denoted with a tilde $\left(\widetilde{\quad}\right)$.} squark couples to a $e^++d$ pair similar a leptoquark $\tilde{S}_{1/2,L}$ with electrical charge of $|Q|=\frac23 e$ would do. Analogous the $\tilde{d}_R$ squark couples to a $e^-+u$ pair or $\nu_e+d$ pair and mimics a $S_0$ leptoquark of charge $|Q|=\frac13 e$. From an experimental view point, the oberservation of such decay is not only restricted to LQ models, but also has implications for the coupling constant of a possible {\SUSY} models. \cite{Kuze}

At proton-proton colliders, like the {\LHC}, the leptoquarks can be be produced in pairs by gluon-fusion and smaller contributions of quark-fusion. These main processes are shown in Feynman graphs in figure \ref{LQpairs}. The upper row describes the gluon initated production and the lower one the quark initiated production. The last Feynman graph (lower right) is proportional to the square of the coupling constant ($\lambda^2$) \cite{hunter}\cite{Hewett}. Cross section calculations for such processes and further details can be found for example in reference \cite{Kramer}.

The detectable final states, in this case with the {\ATLAS} detector, are governed by the Yukawa coupling $\lambda_{lq}$ of the leptoquark directly on the quark $q$ and lepton $l$ (see figure \ref{YukawaLQ}). The model is defined by two parameters derived from $\lambda_{lq}$: The branching ratio $\beta$ and a coupling constant $\lambda$ are connected to the Yukawa coupling constant like $\lambda_{lq}=\sqrt{\beta}\lambda$ for a charged lepton and like $\lambda_{lq}=\sqrt{1-\beta}\lambda$ for neutrinos. \cite{LQATLAS}\par

In this thesis the focus lies on the search of pair produced scalar leptoquarks with the final state $LQ+LQ\rightarrow t\tau^{-}+\bar{t}\tau^{+}$. These final states would correspond to leptoquarks $S_{0,L}$ and $S_{1,L}$ (cf. table \ref{LQstable}). \newline

\chapter{Experimental setup for the search for scalar leptoquarks}\label{experiment}
For the search for scalar leptoquarks the {\ATLAS} detector at the Large Hadron Collider ({\LHC}) is used as experimental setup, which will be described within this chapter. The general setting of the proton-proton collider located at the {\CERN} research center is the topic of section \ref{LHC}. The particle detection of the resulting collision events will take place in the {\ATLAS} detector with its different specialized components (section \ref{ATLAS}). Section \ref{LQpp} addresses the possible leptoquark pair production in proton-proton collisions.

\section{The Large Hadron Collider accelerator complex}\label{LHC}
The research center {\CERN} (Conseil Europ\'{e}en pour la Recherche Nucl\'{e}aire) was founded in $1954$ near Geneva, Switzerland to become a major European joint venture on elementary particle physics. Currently, $22$ member states are participating in that large-scale project with the ambition to probe the essential constituents of nature and the fundamental forces acting between them. \cite{CERNabout}\par

\end{figure}
%
In the accelerator complex protons reach energies of $\SI{6.5}{\tera\electronvolt}$ by going through different accelerator stages and are brought to collisions at defined interaction sites in time intervals of $\SI{25}{\nano\second}$. Particle detectors then register signatures of the resulting collision events and the analysis of newly created particles gives insight to the nature of elementary particle physics.\newline 
Figure \ref{complex} shows the different acceleration stages. Starting from the injection, protons will gain a kinetic energy of $\SI{50}{\mega\electronvolt}$ in the linear accelerator {\LINAC}2 and will be further transferred to the Proton Synchrotron Booster ($\SI{1.4}{\giga\electronvolt}$), the Proton Synchrotron ($\SI{25}{\giga\electronvolt}$), the Super Proton Synchrotron ($\SI{450}{\giga\electronvolt}$) and finally to the {\LHC} ring with its $\SI{26.7}{\kilo\meter}$ circumference. \cite{CERNabout}\newline
The {\LHC} is designed as two-ring proton-proton collider. Conditions for a stable proton beam are diverse, including high vacua of $\SI{E-10}{\milli\bar}$ to $\SI{E-11}{\milli\bar}$ and temperatures of $\SI{1.9}{\kelvin}$ for the superconducting NbTi-magnets of the accelerator. \cite{LHCJINST}\par

Different experiments like \ALICE\cite{ALICE}, {{\LHC}}b\cite{LHCb} are located at the {\LHC} due to the variety of research questions. But the subject of interest in this work lies in the high luminosity experiment {\ATLAS}, which is specialized for proton-proton collisions, like its counterpart \CMS\cite{CMS}. Main tasks of {\ATLAS} are more precise measurements of the SM (see chapter \ref{SM}), better understanding Quantum Chromo Dynamics (QCD) and search for supersymmetric models, and new physics, among others. With the {\LHC} production of $10^9$ inelastic events per second, up to $23$ simultaneously events at dominating high QCD cross sections reqiure a powerful detector that is capable of recognizing the characteristic signatures. These circumstances make up the demands for {\ATLAS}, including fast electronic elements, high detector granularity, handling high particles fluxes and reducing overlapping events at a large acceptance and coverage region. \cite{ATLASJINST}

\section{The ATLAS detector at the LHC}\label{ATLAS}
One of the general purpose detector for proton-proton collisions is the {\ATLAS} detector. This $\SI{25}{\meter}$ tall detector is located at one interaction point of the {\LHC} where bunches, consisting of approximately $\SI{E11}{}$ protons, collide at a rate of $\SI{40}{\mega\hertz}$ \cite{ATLASJINST}. The number of particles encountered per time is given by \cite{Perkins}
\begin{align}
                        \dot{N}=\mathcal{L}\sigma
\end{align}
with the cross section $\sigma$ for the present event and the instantantaneous luminosity $\mathcal{L}$. Given a measure for the number of collisions per unit time the instantaneous luminosity can be introduced and is often used as key parameter in collider physics \cite{LHCJINST}.
\begin{align}
                        \mathcal{L}=\frac{N_bn_bf_{\text{rev}}\gamma_r}{4\pi\epsilon_n\beta^*}F
\label{Lumi}
\end{align}
Where $N_b$ is the number of particles per bunch, $n_b$ the number of bunches per beam, $f_{\text{rev}}$ the rotational frequency, $\gamma_r$ the Lorentz factor, $\epsilon_n$ the normalized transverse beam emittance, $\beta^*$ the betatron function at the collision point and $F$ respects the geometric luminosity reduction factor due to the crossing angle at the collision point. The luminosity of {\ATLAS} exceeded the design luminosity of $\mathcal{L}=\SI{2.05E34}{\per\square\centi\meter\per\second}$ by a factor of $2.05$ on the $2^{\text{nd}}$ of November 2017, emphasizing the great success over the years \cite{designLumiExceeded}.\par

The aspiration to be sensitive to the great variety of particles governed by the fundamental forces (see chapter \ref{SM}) influenced the detector design accordingly. The layered structure reflects the fact that

The nominal interaction point acts as origin of the coordinate system, where the $z$-axis follows the beam line counterclockwise. Perpendicular to the $z$ axis lies the transverse $x$-$y$-plane usually described through the azimuthal angle $\phi$. The positive $x$-axis points towards the center of the {\LHC}. The cylindric symmetry of the detector suggests a cylindric coordinate system with the angle $\theta$ starting from the beamline. \cite{ATLASJINST} Since the polar angle is not a Lorentz invariant quantity, it is useful to describe the position in terms of rapidity \cite{LHCJINST} $w=\frac12\ln{\frac{E+p_zc}{E-p_zc}}$ in that highly relativistic regime. In the limit of large momenta, i.e. $|\mathbf{p}|c\approx E$, the rapidity coincides with the pseudorapidity formulated as \cite{ChinaPseudorapidityBook}
\begin{align}
                        \eta=-\ln{\tan\frac{\theta}{2}}\text{.}
\label{pseudorapidity}
\end{align}
This variable has only the polar angle as dependence and is therefore the adequate quantity in the context of collision experiments, where usually the angle $\theta$ from the beamline is measured. \cite{ChinaPseudorapidityBook}\par

\textbf{The magnet configuration} includes a superconducting solenoid with a field strength of $\SI{2}{\tesla}$ sourrounding the inner detector as well as three large superconducting toroid magnets composed in an eight-fold azimuthal symmetry around the calorimeter. The barrel toroid magnet delivers a field strength of $\SI{0.5}{\tesla}$ and in the end-cap a field of $\SI{1}{\tesla}$ is present. \cite{ATLASJINST}\newline%Bending particle path -->identification... ######
\textbf{The inner detector} is responsible for pattern recognition, momentum and vertex measurements and electrically charged particle identification which is achieved with a combination of semiconductor pixel and microstrip trackers (SCT). The Insertable B-Layer (IBL) is the innermost layer of the pixel detectors at a radius of $\SI{3.3}{\centi\meter}$ away from the beam line. Additional straw tube tracking detectors are sensitive to transistion radiation (TRT) in the outer part that are responsible for high vertex and momentum resolution. The $R-\phi$ segmented pixel detectors are of size $50\times \SI{400}{\square\micro\meter}$ and the SCTs with its $8$ strip layers cover together a range of $|\eta|<2.5$. Typically $36$ hits per track are provided by the $\SI{4}{\milli\meter}$ straw tubes of the TRTs, which cover the range $|\eta|\leq 2.0$. \cite{IBL}\cite{ATLASJINST}\newline %Unterscheidung teilchen anhand der Übergangsstrahlung ####################
Liquid argon electromagnetic sampling \textbf{calorimeters} with high granularity allow an excellent energy measurement for electrons and photons. It has a total thickness of more than $22$ radiation lengths $X_0$ in the barrel region ($|\eta|<1.475$) and more than $24X_0$ in the end-cap region ($1.375<|\eta|<3.2$). For hadronic energy measurements a scintillator-tile calorimeter covering $|\eta|<1.7$ is in operation. It is a sampling calorimeter and uses steel as absorber material and scintillating tiles as active material in conjunction with wavelength shifting fibres. Further LAr technology is used for hadronic particles in the outer pseudorapidity range up to $|\eta|=3.2$. Here copper plates provide the absorber material. The forward calorimeters extend the coverage for hadronic and electromagnetic energy measurements to $|\eta|=4.9$ and are $10X_0$ deep. \cite{ATLASJINST}\newline%Energiemessung: provide god res for high energy jets###################
The \textbf{muon system} is suited in the outer layer of {\ATLAS} and provides as independent system resolution for high energy muon tracks with three layered precision chambers. This is possible because of the air-cored toroid magnet system including one barrel and two end-cap magnets generating strong bending power in a large volume and delivering  a mostly perpendicular magnetic field regarding the muon trajectories. The bending power $\int{\vec{B}d\vec{l}}$ along the track of the muon $d\vec{l}$ reaches $\SI{1.5}{\tesla\meter}$ to $\SI{5.5}{\tesla\meter}$ in the range $|\eta|<1.4$ (barrel) and up to $\SI{7.5}{\tesla\meter}$ (end-cap). The precision chambers are Monitored Drift Tubes (MDT) and in the larger pseudorapidity range Chathode Strip Chambers (CSC) which are multiwire proportional chambers. Due to the fact that the overall performance depends crucially on the alignment of the muon detectors with respect to each other and in respect to the Inner Detector, MDTs are equipped with a optical monitoring system with $1200$ sensors. Resistive Plate Chambers (RPC) and Thin Gap Chambers (TGC) are the constituents of the muon trigger system. \cite{ATLASJINST} \newline %Myonen kommen überall durch-->hier detektieren + Problem der Spurkrümmung für high pt--> eigenes system für die genauere myon-messung ############
Due to technology and resource limitations the data recording rate has to be reduced from $\SI{40}{\mega\hertz}$ to $\SI{200}{\hertz}$. This poses high demands on an efficient \textbf{trigger system} which is organised in three levels. Level $1$ uses only a subset of the total detector information making basic decisions to flag so called regions of interest, i.e. coordinate regions. Searches include patterns for high transverse momenta of muon tracks, electrons and photons as well as jets or large missing energy balances. The output rate after this first selection accounts for $\SI{75}{\kilo\hertz}$. The high level trigger $2$ and $3$ are responsible for selecting the level $1$ triggerd regions at full granularity and precision. The level $3$ event filter is the final stage and achieves data reduction down to the final data-taking rate of $\SI{200}{\hertz}$, writing events of the size of approximately $\SI{1.3}{\mega\byte}$ to the disks. The event filter`s selection criteria are implemented using offline analysis procedures. \cite{ATLASJINST}%efficient triggering with sufficient background rejection ##############

\section{b-tagging at ALTAS -- identifying b-jets}\label{btagging}
The third generation quarks, i.e. top (t) and bottom (b), play a crucial role in the SM and its various extension possibilities like the Leptoquark Model due to their large masses \cite{Hansson}. Therefore, it is essential to identify hadrons containing b quarks and seperating them from light-flavour quarks at hadron collider detectors like {\ATLAS}. This task is commonly reffered as b-tagging and can be seen as a classification problem with the goal to assign right jet flavours. To that end the particle tracks in the Inner Detector and the jet reconstruction of clusters in the electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeter are discriminating objects. \cite{Paganini}\par

 \end{center}
\end{figure}
%
The long lifetime of B hadrons in the order of $\SI{1.6}{\pico\second}$ allow them to travel a few millimeters in the detector. The subsequent decay of those heavy particles within a secondary vertex produce tracks with comparably large impact parameter $d_0$ that is the shortest distance of the particle track from the primary vertex (see figure \ref{btagged}). This signature and the deduced impact parameter significance $S(d_0)=\frac{d_o}{\sigma(d_0)}$, where $\sigma(d_0)$ is the uncertainty of the impact parameter, are used by the b-tagging algorithms including five low-level and two high-level taggers. \cite{Hansson} The b-tagging algorithms rely on multivariate combinations of the information and process them to calculate a discriminant value for each jet. Thresholds on these values are then defining the working point to provide efficiencient identification of b-jets. For better information processing of the combinations of large input parameters neural network classes are used. \cite{Luca} One example for such a trained network is the MV2 tagger which uses 24 input variables of the low-level taggers together with kinematic properties\footnote{For further details on MV2 see \cite{MV2}}. \cite{Paganini}
